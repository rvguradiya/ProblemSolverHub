In this problem we have to create a Multilevel Doubly Linked List from a given array and then we have to flatten it.
Example:-
Given array is: [10,50,5,70,62,93,84,0,0,0,70,50,0,0,67,84,32]

MultiLevel Doubly Linked List will be :

10-->50-->5-->70-->62-->93-->84
          |
	  70-->50
		|
		67-->84
		|
		32


And then when we flatten it. It will give us following result:

10,50,5,70,50,67,32,84,70,62,93,84
